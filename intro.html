<h2>What is Neat?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-neat" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Neat is a C-like statically-typed native compiled language with automated reference counting, OOP and macros.
If you already know <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dlang.org/">D</a>, it’s very similar to D1. But without a garbage collector. And with less powerful
templates. But with macros!</p>
<p>While different platforms are supported in theory, at the moment Neat <strong>only works on Linux.</strong></p>
<p>Compared to D, it has some upsides and some downsides. It’s a lot younger and a lot less tested. It also compiles
a lot slower. (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bright">Walter Bright</a> is an actual wizard.) However, as well as being extensible, it has built-in support
for some things that are cumbersome library constructs in D: sum types, tuples, named parameters, and format strings.
It also comes with built-in package management support.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>I am aware that people who try Neat now are taking a big risk, as the language is still subject to massive change.
To reduce this risk, <strong>Neat contains a mechanism to download, build and execute older versions of the compiler</strong>.
If you pin the compiler version in your package.json, any future version of Neat that may be installed on your
system will still build your project with the original version that you last used. This way, you have full
control of the rate at which your project updates.</p>

<section id="why-make-another-new-language">
<h2>Why make another new language?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-make-another-new-language" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The most important thing to me is that you should <strong>have fun using Neat.</strong> The biggest innovative new language in
C-likes, Rust, is primarily built on not letting you do things. Nobody understands what the hell C++ is doing anymore,
it’s approaching string theory levels of opaqueness. Go is specifically built on the premise that Google developers
are incompetent and must be kept away from any semblance of language power. D is a shining light of developer
empowerment, but <em>:snip ten minutes of gripes with the project:</em>. I believe that writing Neat should be easy and fun.
If you do something stupid, the compiler should tell you with a nice readable error, if you want to do it anyway,
the compiler should get out of your way. If you do things in the straightforward way, you should get straightforward
results. Alternately, if you want to prototype a new syntax or type approach, that should be easy too. A simple,
extensible, expressive core, predictable results, power but no magic. That’s the dream.</p>

<section id="okay-so-what-is-neat-like">
<h2>Okay, so what is Neat like?<a class="headerlink" href="#okay-so-what-is-neat-like" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Neat uses single class inheritance with multiple interfaces; classes are always
reference types, and are intended to control state mutation, whereas structs are by-value, plain old data,
cannot be inherited and are intended to represent domain values.</p>
<p>C style functions look as they do in C.
For high-level code, you can also operate on ranges, which are data types that yield successive values.
This affords a style similar to functional programming at the function level.
This style is supported by lambda expressions and nested functions, creating pure computational
building blocks that are composable and testable.</p>
<p>There’s a rich set of built-in type constructors, including length-aware arrays, hashmaps, sumtypes and tuples.</p>
<p>Variables are immutable and unreferenceable <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#references" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> by default, but can be easily marked as mutable.</p>
<p>Neat code is divided into modules; each module corresponds to one file, and can be non-transitively imported into
other modules.</p>
<p>For reusable code, Neat also has template support, though it’s in the beginning stages. Sum types are reused for
error handling, using built-in syntax to easily propagate errors upcall.</p>
<p>Note that all of these are subject to change as the language develops. Neat is written in idiomatic Neat
and BSD-licensed. The code won’t win any prizes as it stands, but I’m very much open to pull requests. If I’ve made
a stupid decision, anything can be fixed. :-)</p>

<section id="a-digression-why-reference-counting">
<h2>A digression: why reference counting?<a class="headerlink" href="#a-digression-why-reference-counting" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In a divergence from D, Neat uses reference counting as its memory management strategy. With automatic
lifetime tracking, this is mostly transparent to users. While the memory management
is in total more expensive than memory management in D, the costs in memory and cleanup overhead are more
predictable and evenly distributed.</p>
<p>(Turns out that when he said that GC was in total faster, Walter Bright was right. Who could have predicted this.)</p>
<p>Also reference-counting memory management is vulnerable to reference cycles. At the moment, my advice to address
this is to avoid creating reference cycles.</p>
<p>So why am I going with reference counting if I know GC is better?</p>
<p>I’ve been in the D community for a decade and a half. People keep telling us they don’t like the GC.
They keep saying GC is a dealbreaker. They want predictable memory usage and cleanup times. Somehow, none of
this is ever an issue with C# and Java. Somehow, the fact that any memory allocator, including glibc’s, can incur
arbitrary delays never matters. Well, fine! Fine. Whatever. I disagree with the choice, but as an offshoot of
an offshoot, I really can’t afford alienating folks. I’m tired of arguing this point. Nobody has ever said that
reference counting was a dealbreaker. So reference counting it is.</p>

<section id="is-neat-production-ready">
<h2>Is Neat production ready?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-neat-production-ready" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>No. It is not. It is <em>hilariously</em> not.</p>
<p>While every subsystem I really wanted for the language is in place, they’re all somewhere between
90% and 10% built out. Hashmaps support int keys and string keys only. Overloading is barely a thing. Vectors are in,
but not matrices. <em>Every part of the language</em> is like that. Any commit I try to make to a non-compiler Neat project
requires me to make another to compiler, to fix the issues that inevitably crop up.
(That’s an improvement. It used to be two.)</p>
<p>But that said, it works. It runs, it can read source and compile it. And, you know, even now, even unfinished as it is,
I’d like to think that some parts are pretty slick. Even neat, if you will. ;-)</p>

<section id="a-note-on-security">
<h2>A note on security<a class="headerlink" href="#a-note-on-security" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Neat has no runtime limitations on macros. A macro can do anything that the compiler itself can do. As a result,
any package you include can run arbitrary code on your system. While this may seem unsafe, how often do you build
a binary and then not run it anyways? Meanwhile, any build system that lets dependencies add prebuild steps,
which is pretty much all of them, already allows unrestricted code execution. If you run a build farm, you already know
to always run builds in VMs. As a private user, just keep in mind that building a Neat project is as good as
running it, from a security perspective.</p>
